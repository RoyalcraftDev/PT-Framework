# Introduction to the framework

Hello there, and welcome to ProjectTerra.Framework! This is an open-source framework for creating cross-platform games, with a main focus being to reduce the amount of effort to write a game from scratch, and provide all the necessary tools to run the project, including building, running, and debugging with a localized machinery.

What this means, it allows you to create literally anything only knowing C# and basics of the game architecture. Everything else that is complicated, like building for another platform, is made entirely for you, without headaches that I solved for you :)

You can find more information on the framework in the [PT-Framework](https://github.com/TsukimotoX/PT-Framework) repository, but for this case documentation, we're gonna learn the basics of the framework and how you can create a simple game with it.

Next page you turn is a [quickstart guide](Quickstart.md), so let's get started!
